    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk  </li>
        <li>½ cup water </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt t </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted  </li>
      
    </ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the
            milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
            griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with
            a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>

            spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
